            "A **prompt** is the instruction you give to an AI model. Think of it like a creative brief — "
            "the clearer you are, the better the output.\n\n"
            "**Prompt Engineering** is the practice of crafting clear and effective inputs (prompts) to guide large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4. "
            "Think of it like writing instructions to a very smart assistant — the better your instructions, the better the output.\n\n"
            "#### Why It Matters for Startups\n"
            "- Speeds up content generation and prototyping\n"
            "- Powers customer support chatbots and assistants\n"
            "- Helps in idea generation, naming, and brainstorming\n"
            "- Reduces reliance on manual copywriting, support, or even coding"
        ),
        "Types of Prompts": (
            "Different types of prompts serve different needs. Here are the most common:\n\n"
            "#### Zero-shot Prompting\n"
            "No examples are provided. The model relies entirely on the instruction.\n"
            "- *Example:* \"Write a one-line product description for a fitness tracker.\"\n\n"
            "#### One-shot Prompting\n"
            "A single example is included.\n"
            "- *Example:*  \n"
            "  Q: What’s 2 + 2? A: 4  \n"
            "  Q: What’s 7 + 5?\n\n"
            "#### Few-shot Prompting\n"

            "- *Example:*  \n"
            "  \"Translate: EN: Hello → ES: Hola. EN: Thank you → ES: Gracias.\"\n\n"
            "#### Instructional vs Conversational\n"
            "- **Instructional:** Direct commands like “Summarize this email in 3 lines.”\n"
            "- **Conversational:** Framed as a dialogue, e.g., “Hi! Can you help me explain this concept to a 10-year-old?”"
        ),
        "Vague vs. Clear Examples": (
            "#### Vague Prompt\n"

            "- Write something about our new feature\n\n"
            "#### Clear Prompt\n"

        "Prompt Best Practices": (
            "Great prompts are clear, structured, and targeted.\n\n"
            "#### Key Techniques\n"
            "- **Be Clear & Specific:** Avoid vague instructions.\n"
            "- **Use Delimiters:** Separate instructions from content with `\"\"\"` or `---`.\n"
            "- **Step-by-Step Instructions:** Ask the model to \"explain step-by-step\" when needed.\n"
            "- **Set a Role:** E.g., \"You are a technical recruiter.\"\n"
            "- **Define Output Format:** Specify number of bullets, length, tone, etc.\n"
            "- **Iterate:** Rerun and refine based on what works.\n\n"

        "Common Pitfalls": (
            "Even simple prompts can fail if they're poorly structured. Here are key mistakes to avoid:\n\n"
            "- **Ambiguity:** “Tell me about our product” — too vague.\n"
            "- **Overloading Instructions:** Don't cram 5 tasks into 1 prompt.\n"
            "- **Missing Context:** Always provide enough background for the model to understand the task."

        "Prompt Engineering vs Prompt Tuning": (

            "  Uses well-crafted text prompts to control output. No training required. Fast and flexible.\n\n"
            "- **Prompt Tuning (Advanced)**  \n"
            "  Involves fine-tuning the model on a custom dataset. Requires ML knowledge, compute resources, and time.\n\n"

        "Startup Use Cases": (
            "Prompt engineering can unlock huge value across startup functions:\n\n"
            "- **Marketing:** Social media posts, taglines, blog intros\n"
            "- **Customer Support:** Smart autoresponders, refund replies\n"
            "- **Product & Dev:** Auto-generate feature descriptions, bug summaries\n"
