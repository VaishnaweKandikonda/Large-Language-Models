            "A large language model (LLM) is an AI system trained to generate and understand human-like text. "
            "It can help you write, summarize, explain, and automate content in your startup workflows."
        ),
        "Is ChatGPT the same as a search engine?": (
            "No. ChatGPT doesn’t search the internet live. It generates responses based on patterns learned from training data. "
            "It doesn’t verify facts, so double-check anything important."
        ),
        "Why does it sometimes say things that are wrong?": (
            "This is called a hallucination. The model doesn’t know what’s true — it just predicts what sounds right. "
            "Always review AI-generated content before using it externally."
        ),
        "How can I control the tone or creativity of the AI's response?": (
            "Use the temperature setting. Lower values (e.g., 0.2) generate more factual, safe content. "
            "Higher values (e.g., 0.8) create more creative or varied outputs."
        ),
        "Will using LLMs increase my startup’s costs?": (
            "It can. LLMs charge based on token usage. Use prompt optimization, shorter outputs, model tiering (e.g., GPT-3.5 over GPT-4), "
            "and batch processing to control costs."
        ),
        "Can I use LLMs for decisions like hiring or pricing?": (
            "Only with caution. LLMs can reflect social bias and make mistakes. Never automate high-stakes decisions without human review."
        ),
        "How do I avoid biased or exclusionary outputs?": (
            "Test prompts using diverse scenarios. Be mindful of wording that assumes gender, age, or culture. "
            "Use a review process before publishing AI-generated content."
